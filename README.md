# Simon Game README

## Introduction

The Simon Game is a classic memory game where players have to remember and repeat a sequence of colors. This web-based version of the Simon Game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with jQuery for DOM manipulation.

## Features

1. **Gameplay:** Players start the game by pressing any key. The game then presents a sequence of colored buttons that light up in a specific order. Players must replicate this sequence by clicking on the buttons in the correct order.

2. **Levels:** Each successful replication of the sequence increases the level of difficulty. The game displays the current level on the screen.

3. **Audio Feedback:** The game provides audio feedback for correct and incorrect guesses. Each color has its distinct sound associated with it.

4. **Visual Feedback:** Buttons light up and fade to indicate the sequence to be remembered. Clicking on a button triggers a visual effect to provide feedback to the player.
